# New Venture Therapy – React Web App

## Overview

This project is a React + TypeScript rewrite of my existing “New Venture Therapy” business site I created for my sisters new therapy business. The goal was to take my custom  hand-coded HTML/CSS/JavaScript site and turn it into a modern single-page application using a front-end framework and client-side routing.

The app is a small site for a fictional therapy practice. It focuses on:

- A clear landing page for potential clients
- A services overview page
- An appointment booking/contact page
- A shared header and footer rendered across all routes

The original site dynamically injected header, footer, and content modules using vanilla JavaScript. In this version, those pieces are implemented as reusable React components with React Router handling navigation between pages.

### Running the App Locally
